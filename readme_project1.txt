Student Name: Gwendalyn Toh Kai Li

Project Name: Pet Shop

What I implemented:
I implemented 4 NPCs that can be found in a pet shop. 
Bird - Roams around at high speeds, often chased by the dog
Dog - Chases bird often, occasionally gets distracted by owner
Owner - Stops and sits once in a while
Customer - Find the owner for help occasionally 

Directions (if needed):
NIL

What I liked about the project and framework:
It was quite flexible and creative. 
We never get CS assignments like this in the Singapore campus. 
It was a jarring, but fresh change of pace.

What I disliked about the project and framework:
Framework has barely any documentation. 
I felt that I took longer trying to understand 
how to use the framework instead of actually using it.

Any difficulties I experienced while doing the project:
There were a bunch of nodes which I was unsure of 
how they were implemented and bottlenecked my progress quite a bit.

My experience working on this project:
I started the day after this project was announced, 
but only completed it hours before the final submission timing. 
Even then, I did not do this before and had to redo the 
project 3 times before it was functioning decently.
The TA was a lot of help and was able to unstuck me when I hit a wall.
This heped me progress a lot faster, 
but even then I always felt like I was very behind when doing this project.

Hours spent: 40
